### Description

March 26 - Added a library check for gdiplus.

March 25 - Added gdiplus routine allowing icons with alpha channels to be drawn without need for a manifest, making 32b alpha icons available on any OS with gdiplus installed.

March 18 - Fixed some issues with the property page and example, and uploaded the new version.

Add multiple, integrated 32 bit image lists with property pages to any usercontrol with this class/property page, and just a couple of simple steps. I will be adding this code to the grid project and thought I'd provide a simple demo..
